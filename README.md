Automated the Servers setup of Virtual labs(Cluster) using ansible (Configuration management
tool). This ansible creates an environment for automation. The whole configuring servers is done
using this ansible tool. This is done in Linux operating system(Centos).

Automated the whole setup such that we just need to clone it from git-hub and run make file. This
sets up the configuration required
